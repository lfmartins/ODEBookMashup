    "In this tutorial, we cover the basics of IPython (pronouced \"eye-python\"), SciPy and matplotilib. No previous knowledge of Python or programming is assumed. In fact, we encourage the use of iPython as a platform for experimenting and testing code. This is, in the author's experience, the best way to learn to use new software, learning a new programming language, or being exposed to computer programming for the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn about the following technologies:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Python__: the computer language on which iPython, SciPy and matplotlib are based on.\n",
    "- __IPython__: the interface we will use to interact with Python. That is, the worksheet you are looking at.\n",
    "- __SciPy__: a comprehensive library for scientific computing.\n",
    "- __matplotlib__: a library for plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't be intimidated by al the names and fancy terminology. Using all the different software components is pretty seamless (thanks to iPython). The main purpose of listing the different components is to make the reader aware of what is involved, in case she wants to search for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching for more information, by the way, is inevitable. It is in the nature of any tutorial to be of limited scope. At the end of each section we will list links and references to other resources."
